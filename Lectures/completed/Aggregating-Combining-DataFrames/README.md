# Aggregating and Combining DataFrames

The main goals here are to introduce more pandas tools like `.groupby()`, `.pivot()` and `.merge()`, and then give students some practice in analysis with the Animal Center dataset.

Materials:
- [Jupyter Notebook: Aggregating and Combining DataFrames](aggregating_combining_dataframes.ipynb)

## Learning Goals

- Use GroupBy objects to organize and aggregate data
- Create pivot tables from DataFrames
- Combine DataFrames by merging, joining, and concatinating
