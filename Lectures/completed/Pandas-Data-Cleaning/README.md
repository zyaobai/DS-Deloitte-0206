# Pandas Data Cleaning

The goal here is to cover more sophisticated bits of Python syntax focused around data cleaning.

Materials: 
- [Jupyter Notebook: Pandas Data Cleaning](pandas_data_cleaning.ipynb)

## Learning Goals

- Handle missing data, and recognize when different strategies for handling missing data would be appropriate
- Use DataFrame methods (and sometimes lambda functions) to transform data
- Use string methods to transform object-type columns
