# Introducing the Terminal

The main goal here is just to introduce enough UNIX / bash commands so that students can effectively navigate their file directories at the command line, so they can collaborate using Git/the command line for projects without relying on the GitHub GUI (and navigate out of potential merge commit messages or other times they get kicked into vim). Additionally, in this session students are encouraged to create a 'Flatiron' folder to contain all program contents, and thus begin thinking about how best to organize the materials they're cloning down and working on locally (or projects).
